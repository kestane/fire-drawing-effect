# Audio Assets

## Folder Structure

### `/ambient/` 
Place your ambient background music files here.

**Supported Formats:**
- `.mp3` (recommended for compatibility)
- `.wav` (higher quality, larger files)
- `.ogg` (good compression, modern browsers)

**Recommended Files:**
- `ambient-1.mp3` - Main ambient track
- `ambient-2.mp3` - Alternative ambient track  
- `ambient-3.mp3` - Third ambient option

## Usage

The app will automatically detect and load audio files from the `/ambient/` folder. The background music system will randomly cycle through available tracks.

## File Recommendations

- **Length:** 2-10 minutes per track (will loop seamlessly)
- **Volume:** Pre-normalized to consistent levels
- **Style:** Atmospheric, non-intrusive ambient music
- **BPM:** 60-90 BPM for relaxing effects

## File Naming

Use descriptive names:
- `forest-ambient.mp3`
- `space-atmosphere.mp3` 
- `underwater-calm.mp3`
- `mystical-drone.mp3`

The app will display the filename (without extension) in the music controls.
